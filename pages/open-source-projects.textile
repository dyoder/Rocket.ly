Over the years, I've written numerous open source libraries. The main ones are:


* "Waves":/waves, a Ruby framework for Web applications

* "DateJS":http://datejs.org/, an advanced JavaScript date library

* "Autocode":http://github.com/waves/autocode, a Ruby library for on-demand code loading and generation

* "Functor":http://github.com/waves/functor, a Ruby library for pattern-based function / method dispatch

Note that, oddly, none of the reference implementations for these libraries are actually in my own "personal github repo":http://github.com/dyoder.
