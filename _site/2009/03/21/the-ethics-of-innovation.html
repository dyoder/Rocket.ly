<p>I grew up in Detroit, but I&#8217;ve got no love for American automakers. I think bailing them out is a waste of money. I want them to die and for Detroit to move on and find an industry who treats them better. Like Eminem, for example.<br />
  <br />
Why do I hate them? Because they don&#8217;t innovate.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with that? Well, when your products spew megatons of pollutants into the air and you not only <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-emissions27-2009jan27,0,90848.story">don&#8217;t try to solve the problem</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car">you actively sabotage potential solutions</a>, you&#8217;re, um, evil. You&#8217;re selling planetary cigarettes.</p>
<p>Then we get into the usual debates about the nature of evil, yada, yada, yada, and the next thing you know, we&#8217;re talking about the <span class="caps">RIAA</span>. Evil. Why? Like the automakers, they <a href="http://www.riaaintimidation.com/2008/09/19/student-accuses-riaa-and-associates-of-intimidation/">block innovation</a> to maintain the status quo, <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/11/20/emusic-250-million-songs-downloaded-itunes-5-billion/">even when it is obviously profitable</a> to purse another course. (And, no, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001112">it&#8217;s not stealing</a>, for God&#8217;s sake.)</p>
<p>And, no, there&#8217;s no difference really. True, automakers may be driving us off a global-warming cliff in our SUVs, while the <span class="caps">RIAA</span> just keeps suing broke college kids, but it&#8217;s just a question of degree. So to speak. Either way, you&#8217;re getting in the way of people trying to make the world a better and cooler place. So to speak. (Sorry, I can&#8217;t seem to stop.)</p>
<p>Civilization itself is based on the premise of innovation and progress. Was there a hunter-gatherer coalition burning down crops at the dawn of agriculture? Probably. Later, they would form the basis of our present day <span class="caps">NRA</span> and sell homemade deer jerky at farmers&#8217; markets.</p>
<p>Life itself is about innovation. Darwin knew this, but carefully kept his theory of evolution a secret for two decades to keep the Bible thumpers from freaking out. To this day, they haven&#8217;t stopped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism">freaking out</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_research">trying to block innovation</a>.</p>
<p>Is progress <em>always</em> good? Well, sort of by definition, yeah. And even when it <a href="http://stillfootball.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/mushroom-cloud.jpg">appears to be bad</a>, the truth is, &#8220;progress&#8221; is no better or worse than we, the people, are. Cynics will always view progress as bad for this reason. But that&#8217;s not an ethical issue, that&#8217;s just a question of taking the right meds. Yes, you. Stop yelling at your TV. They can&#8217;t hear you.</p>
<p>Cynics also hate capitalism and believe money is the root of all evil. But the saying is actually that <em>the love of money</em> is the root of all evil. Technology is a powerful thing. Pursued without any sense of responsibility for what we create, innovation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet">can obviously become dangerous</a>. But that is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMINSD7MmT4&amp;feature=related">a choice we make</a>. Just like whether to take our meds.</p>
<p>What is certain is the world is still a troubled place. Maybe a college kid jamming out to their favorite band in their dorm instead of staring longingly at the CD rack at the mall is the <a href="http://sciencedude.freedomblogging.com/2008/04/24/can-the-flap-of-butterflies-affect-hurricane-season/">butterfly</a>, and the hurricane is that the <a href="http://sciencedude.freedomblogging.com/2008/04/24/can-the-flap-of-butterflies-affect-hurricane-season/">polar ice caps stop melting</a>.</p>
